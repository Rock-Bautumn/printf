     _printf -- formatted output

SYNOPSIS
     int _printf (const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     The _printf() function produces output according to a format.
	 The format string is a character string passed to the function. It is
	 composed of zero or more directives, conversion specifications as indicated
	 by '%' followed by a specifier.
	 This function is similar to the <stdio.h> printf()

Conversion Specifiers
These specifiers follow the '%' character and indicate conversion type.

	  c - corresponding optional argument is converted to type unsigned char

	  s - corresponding optional argument is of type char *

	  % - if another '%' is passed a specifier to '%', a single '%' character is
	  printed to standard output.

	  d, i - corresponding optional argument is converted into signed decimal
	  notation

RETURN VALUE
The return value of _printf is the number of printed characters (excluding the
null byte used to end output to strings)
